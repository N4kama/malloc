To build the program, just run the command "make" or "make all".
To delete the program, just run "make clean".

You can then call the program by typing "./myfind" followed by
your arguments.

You can also run automated tests by typing "make check"
(this will compile the program if it wasn't already built).

Usage :

-./myfind <options> <path(s)> <expressions>

--> Option can be any of the following (0 or many) :

    <-[dHLP]>

--> Expression can be any of the following (0 or many) :

    <-name "<pattern>"> <-type [bcdflps]> <-print> <-exec <command>\;>
