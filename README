MALLOC :

MALLOC is a c program that allocates memory for other programs.

To build the library, just run the command "make" or "make all".
To delete the library, just run "make clean".

You can then call any program with the libmalloc.so library by typing
"LD_PRELOAD=./libmalloc.so" followed by your program and its arguments.

You can also run automated tests by typing "make check"
(this will compile the program if it wasn't already built).
NB: "Make check" will ask your 2 parameters :
    - First one is to choose between a small test or a heavy and long one.
    - Second one is to choose whether to display the result of the programs
      or not.

Usage :

- LD_PRELOAD=./libmalloc.so <program> [ option(s) ]
